# WCT Image Emporium

welcome to WCT's humble and communal first online stash of art, funk, good
vibes, and things of that nature. this project is meant to preserve and
catalogue the cool & aesthetically+pleasing works from the mindwarriors of the
community/movement known as weird celtics twitter as we transcend the various
space and time planes of loving basket ball and making good posts. welcome to
erotic city; check out some code.

rules (more like guidelines, suggestions perhaps):
- smarf for dpoy
- no cops ⛔️
- shoot wet 3s
- wahlburgers must burn

## Getting Started

clone this badboy and start hacking... collaborators are always welcome! you'll
need some keys, though. official recommendation/decree is that you should
probably set up your own resources for local development, since the application
shouldn't depend necessarily on any one set of credentials if it's set up right
(it probably is, but sometimes god is right and man is wrong). ultimately the
whole platform should be pretty content-agnostic, so consider this an invitation
to all, even wetbuckets. if anything in the next few sections on how to get up &
running isn't clear, don't hesitate to beseech your local friendly ghost of john
gode with questions/concerns.

<!-- ### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo -->

## Running the tests

*for now:*
run `rails test`

*for later:*
hope you like [jest][jest-link] because that's what we're using when we slap a
client side app on this old war wagon. there will probably be a bash script
that runs both (more? all?) test suites in the project.

<!-- ### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system -->

## Built With

* [ruby on rails][rails-url] - server side persistence and json api
* [react][react-url] - client side application
* [typescript][typescript-url] - for client side type safety
* [webpack][webpack-url] - for transpilation and dev serving
<!-- rails ships with webpacker now but shakacode remains on my pay no mind list -->

* [minitest][minitest-url] - back end testing
* [jest][jest-url] - front end testing

* [rubocop][rubocop-url] - nonlethal back end style enforcement
* [tslint][tslint-url] - possibly lethal front end style enforcement
